    Auto Accidents
  </h2>

  <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
    When you’ve been involved in an automobile accident, your life can be
    turned upside down in an instant. Florida law provides that you are
    entitled to be compensated by the at-fault driver for your injuries and
    the damage to your vehicle.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
    In Florida, you have only 14 days to seek medical attention or else waive
    important insurance benefits. This is just one reason to consult with an
    attorney as soon as possible following your automobile accident. The
    attorneys at McCulloch Law, P.A. are here to determine what insurance
    benefits are available and make sure you receive the maximum compensation
    for your auto accident.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
    Following an auto accident, it is important to call the police and ask
    for a police report. Make sure the police get the other driver’s driver
    license and insurance information. You’ll also want to document the
    accident by taking photographs of the scene of the accident, your
    vehicle, and the at-fault driver’s vehicle; this evidence may be of great
    use in your case against the at-fault driver. If you’ve been injured in
    the accident, seek the appropriate medical treatment to not only receive
    the necessary treatment, but also to document your injuries. The
    insurance companies may reach out to you to take a statement or offer you
    money to drop the case; in no event should you speak to any insurance
    company without an attorney. This is why it is important to call an
    attorney as soon as possible to make sure your rights are protected.

    Bicycle Accidents

    Pinellas County, Florida has the highest cyclist death rate in the Tampa Bay
    metro area – which has the highest rate of any metro region in the United
    States. If you ride a bicycle in Tampa or St. Pete, you know how dangerous
    the roads can be for cyclists.
  </p>

 
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Narrow bike lanes, confusing traffic signals, and distracted drivers are just
    a few of the dangers that you need to be aware of every time you get on your

    contact an attorney to guide you through the process of making a claim

    Protect Yourself: Wear a Helmet

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    The number one precaution you can take as a cyclist is to wear a helmet. This
    not only affects your legal case, but more importantly, it could save your
    life. Helmet use reduces the odds of head injury by 50%, and head, face, or
    neck injury by 33%. Always wear a helmet approved by the federal CPSC Safety
    Standard.

    The Lawyer You Need To Call In Tampa, FL After A Trucking Accident
  </h2>

 
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    McCulloch Law, P.A. was built by Tampa native, Drew McCulloch. He has been a
    personal injury and criminal defense attorney since 2010. McCulloch Law,

  </p>

 
  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    How Common Are Trucking Accidents in Tampa, FL?
  </h3>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Florida has seen a steady increase in collisions involving large trucks. The
    state currently ranks third in the country for truck accident fatalities.
    Because of its central location and commerce, Tampa is prone to accidents.
    As the population continues to grow, the number of accidents does, too.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    These accidents are almost always due to driver error; however, there are
    exceptions. The most common causes of trucking accidents are:
  </p>

 
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    <li>Speeding</li>
    <li>Traffic flow interruption</li>
    <li>Distracted driving</li>
    <li>Fatigued driving</li>
    <li>Weather conditions</li>
    <li>Road construction</li>
    <li>Cargo overload</li>
    <li>Vehicle malfunctions</li>
    <li>Prescription drug use</li>
  </ul>

 
  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    Why Do You Need A Truck Accident Attorney?
  </h3>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    When a trucking accident occurs, those in a passenger vehicle are typically
    the most affected. Unfortunately, accidents involving trucks are more
    complex than those involving two regular-sized vehicles. The size and weight
    of commercial trucks often lead to more severe injuries and significant
    vehicle damage.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Additionally, trucking accidents often involve multiple insured parties — the
    truck driver, their employer, and even the truck leasing company. These
    cases require investigation into:
  </p>

 
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    <li>Driver regulations</li>
    <li>Logs</li>
    <li>Vehicle maintenance</li>
    <li>Details about the truck & cargo load</li>
    <li>Witness statements</li>
  </ul>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    A truck accident attorney helps you navigate this process to ensure you are
    properly compensated while you focus on recovering.
  </p>

 
  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    When Do You Need To Make A Claim After A Truck Accident Injury?
  </h3>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    In Florida, you must seek medical care within 14 days after an accident or
    risk waiving certain insurance benefits.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Additionally, trucking companies only retain certain data—such as driver logs
    and maintenance records—for limited periods. Delaying your claim could make
    vital evidence unavailable.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Contacting a truck accident lawyer as soon as possible ensures they can begin
    collecting information from the trucker, the company, witnesses, and vehicle
    logs.
  </p>

 
  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    What Type Of Compensation Could I Expect After A Truck Crash?
  </h3>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Compensation after a trucking accident depends on several factors, including:
  </p>

  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    <li>The severity of your injuries</li>
    <li>Your required medical care</li>
    <li>Any future medical needs</li>
    <li>Lost wages</li>
    <li>The time missed from work</li>
    <li>The long-term impact on your ability to work</li>
    <li>Life-altering consequences of the accident</li>
  </ul>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Florida is a comparative negligence state, meaning fault may be shared.
    However, you can still seek damages even if you are partially responsible
    for the accident.

    Motorcycle Accidents
  </h2>

 
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Motorcycle accidents can be especially devastating, given the fact that a
    motorcycle driver or rider has no seatbelt or large vehicle to protect
    them. Motorcyclists are approximately 28 times more frequently killed in a
    traffic crash compared to occupants of passenger cars.
  </p>

 
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Many times, other drivers on the road do not pay enough attention to
    motorcyclists. This is why vigilance is crucial when riding. If you’ve been
    injured in a motorcycle accident through someone else’s fault, Florida law
    entitles you to compensation. The attorneys at McCulloch Law, P.A. are here
    to help.

  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    Protect Yourself: Wear a Helmet
  </h3>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    The number one precaution you can take as a motorcyclist is wearing a helmet.
    It impacts your legal case and, more importantly, your survival. Motorcycle
    helmets reduce the risk of head injury by 69% and the risk of death by 42%.
    Always wear a DOT-approved helmet whenever you ride.

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    When you’ve been involved in an Uber, UberEats, or Lyft accident, the amount
    of coverage you may receive depends on whether you were in another vehicle,
    a passenger of the Uber/Lyft vehicle, or the driver of the rideshare
    vehicle. Additionally, if you are the driver, coverages may vary depending
    on whether your app is inactive, if you have accepted a fare and are en

    The experienced attorneys at McCulloch Law, P.A. can guide you on the types

  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Our goal is always to help you obtain full compensation for your losses.
    Florida law states that you are entitled to compensation from the at-fault

    reason why consulting an attorney as soon as possible is crucial. The

  </p>

 
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    After an Uber, UberEats, or Lyft accident, it is important to call the
    police and request a police report. Ensure the officer documents the other

    evidence may be critical in your case.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    If you’ve been injured, seek appropriate medical care to treat and document

    Slip and Fall Accidents
  </h2>

 
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Despite common misconceptions, an unexpected fall on a hard surface can lead to serious personal injuries. More than one million people visit the emergency room each year due to slip and fall incidents, which are a leading cause of injury across all age groups. After a slip or trip and fall, you may be unsure of what caused your accident.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    The experienced attorneys at McCulloch Law, P.A. can investigate your fall, gather evidence, and guide you through the process of filing a slip and fall or trip and fall claim. Many incidents are preventable if property owners maintain their premises safely and monitor for hazards.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Whether you’re a customer in a business or walking on a public sidewalk, the entity responsible for the property owes you a duty to keep you reasonably safe, except in the case of trespassers. The duty owed depends on whether you are an invitee or a licensee. Our attorneys can evaluate your claim and advise on the specific duty owed to you.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    After a slip and fall accident, notify the store or property manager and request an incident report, making sure to get the manager’s full name and a copy of the report. Document the scene and your injuries with photographs. Seek medical treatment promptly to both receive care and properly document your injuries. Do not speak to the property owner’s insurance company or risk management department without an attorney — they may try to settle quickly to minimize their liability.

    Property owners in Florida have a duty to maintain their property in a reasonably safe condition for people who are lawfully on the property — and in some cases, even for trespassers. This duty extends not only to the property itself but also to the staff of a business.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Premises liability cases include slip and fall accidents, negligent security (such as a bouncer using excessive force or a hotel failing to stop a deadly incident), potholes in parking lots, negligent staffing (like a daycare employee injuring a child), and many other types of injuries. If you’ve been injured while on someone else’s property, the attorneys at McCulloch Law, P.A. can help you evaluate your case.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Each year, thousands of people are injured while in the home of another, whether it be a friend, family member, or neighbor. Many times, your injury will be covered by the homeowner’s insurance of the property owner. When someone invites you into their home, they have a duty to ensure your safety and to warn you of all known dangers. If you’ve been injured in someone else’s home, you may be entitled to compensation through their homeowner’s insurance. Our attorneys can investigate the claim and advise you on available coverage and potential compensation amounts.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    After an injury on someone else’s property, notify the manager or homeowner. If the incident occurred at a business, request an incident report and the full name of the store manager, and obtain a copy for your records. Document your injury and the scene with photographs. Seek medical treatment promptly to ensure proper care and documentation. Do not speak to any insurance company or risk management department without an attorney, as they may attempt to settle quickly to minimize liability.

    Dog Bites
  </h2>

  
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    In Florida, dog owners are “strictly liable” if their dog injures someone. This means there is no need to prove negligence — a victim can bring a claim even if the owner was unaware of the dog’s aggressiveness.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    If you were bitten while on public land, such as a dog park, or lawfully on private property, you likely have a claim against the dog’s owner. Florida law provides few exceptions to a dog owner’s liability.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Dogs bite approximately 4.7 million people each year in the U.S. Dog parks can be particularly risky since you cannot know the other dogs’ behavior or training. Small children are often at greatest risk, as they cannot defend themselves. Many dog bite victims require reconstructive surgery, stitches, therapy, counseling, and more. The attorneys at McCulloch Law, P.A. understand the devastating impact of a dog attack.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Homeowners’ insurance companies paid $675 million in dog bite and dog-related claims in 2018. After a dog bite, notify local authorities or animal control and call the police. Obtain a copy of the animal control report. Document your injuries, the scene, and the dog if it can be done safely. Seek medical treatment promptly to document your injuries and receive care. Do not speak to any insurance company without an attorney, as they may try to settle quickly to minimize liability.

    Medical Malpractice
  </h2>

  
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    In the United States, we trust doctors and medical personnel to care for us in our times of greatest need. Whether it’s an ambulance ride after an accident, emergency surgery, elective cosmetic surgery, or a routine check-up, medical professionals are expected to use their best judgment and the skills they have gained through years of education and experience.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Unfortunately, medical errors sometimes occur. Mistakes like amputating the wrong limb or leaving instruments inside a patient are examples of medical malpractice. Victims of medical malpractice in Florida have the right to seek compensation.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    While many believe medical malpractice is rare, surgical errors are the third-leading cause of death in the United States, with at least 250,000 deaths each year attributed to medical errors. Medical malpractice claims include errors during surgery, childbirth, cancer diagnosis, and treatment of common medical conditions. Florida has seen some of the largest malpractice payouts in history, including a $216.7 million jury award for a misdiagnosed stroke. The attorneys at McCulloch Law, P.A. can investigate your claim to determine what the doctor did or did not do that may have changed the medical outcome. Medical malpractice can result in serious lifelong complications or death.

    Products Liability
  </h2>

  
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Product liability is the area of law in which manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, retailers, and others who make products available to the public are held legally responsible for injuries caused by those products.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Generally, a products liability claim falls into one of three categories:
  </p>

  <ul className="list-decimal list-inside text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    <li>
      <strong>Design Defects:</strong> Present in a product from the beginning, making it inherently unsafe.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Manufacturing Defects:</strong> Occur during the manufacturing or assembly process.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Marketing Defects:</strong> Flaws in product marketing, such as improper labeling, insufficient instructions, or inadequate safety warnings.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Products liability cases include, but are not limited to, faulty car manufacturing, exploding e-cigarettes or vaporizers, tobacco products, silicone breast implants, asbestos building materials, faulty construction equipment, defective space heaters, unsafe food products, and any other product that causes injury while being used as intended.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Products liability is generally considered a strict liability offense, meaning a defendant is liable if the product is defective, regardless of intent. Recalled children’s toys or automobiles are common examples. If you or a loved one has been injured by a defective product, contact the attorneys at McCulloch Law, P.A. so they can investigate and evaluate your case.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    After a product-related injury, document the injury and the defective product with photographs. Keep the defective product, as it will assist your attorney in evaluating the case and may prevent legal complications. Seek medical treatment promptly to receive care and document your injuries.

    What Are 1st And 2nd Degree Arson?
  </h2>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Arson and Criminal Mischief are crimes of intentional property damage. 
    First-degree arson occurs when a person willfully and unlawfully, or while committing a felony, uses fire or explosives to damage:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
    <li>Any dwelling (occupied or not)</li>
    <li>Any structure where people are normally present</li>
    <li>Any other structure that they knew or reasonably knew is occupied</li>
  </ul>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Second-degree arson occurs when a person willfully and unlawfully, or while committing a felony, uses fire or explosives to damage any property not included in first-degree arson.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl  font-bold text-black leading-snug mt-4">
    Criminal Mischief
  </h2>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Criminal Mischief in Florida is the willful and unlawful damage of property. Arson is the willful and unlawful damage of property with fire. A third related crime is <strong>Burning to Defraud an Insurer</strong>, which involves intentionally burning property to collect an insurance settlement.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl  font-bold text-black leading-snug mt-4">
    Arson Resulting In Injury
  </h2>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    To prove Arson Resulting in Injury, the prosecution must show:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
    <li>You willfully and unlawfully instigated a fire or explosion, or triggered one while committing a felony</li>
    <li>The fire or explosion damaged:
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 space-y-1">
        <li>A dwelling (occupied or non-occupied)</li>
        <li>A structure or contents normally occupied by people</li>
        <li>A structure you knew or should have known would be occupied</li>
        <li>A structure owned by yourself under other circumstances</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 className="text-2xl  font-bold text-black leading-snug mt-4">
    Burning To Defraud An Insurer
  </h2>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    To prove this crime, the prosecution must establish that:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
    <li>You burned, attempted to burn, or caused burning of insured property</li>
    <li>The property belonged to you</li>
    <li>The property was insured against loss or damage</li>
    <li>You acted willfully with intent to injure or defraud the insurer</li>
  </ul>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Defrauding an insurer can also result in additional charges for arson and filing a false insurance claim. Arson may fall under Florida’s 10-20-Life law.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl  font-bold text-black leading-snug mt-4">
    Elements Of Criminal Mischief
  </h2>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    To prove Criminal Mischief, the prosecution must show beyond a reasonable doubt:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
    <li>The defendant injured or damaged property (real or personal)</li>
    <li>The property belonged to the alleged victim</li>
    <li>The injury or damage was done willfully and maliciously</li>
  </ul>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    "Willfully" means intentionally, knowingly, and purposely. "Maliciously" means wrongfully and intentionally without legal justification, with knowledge that injury or damage may occur.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl  font-bold text-black leading-snug mt-4">
    Offenses Against Computer Users
  </h2>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Florida Statute 815.06(2) prohibits unauthorized access or damage to computers, networks, or electronic devices, including:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
    <li>Unauthorized access or disruption of data</li>
    <li>Damaging equipment, systems, or devices</li>
    <li>Introducing contaminants or malware</li>
    <li>Engaging in unauthorized surveillance via a computer or device</li>
  </ul>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    First-degree felony charges apply if human life is endangered or medical equipment is affected. Misdemeanor charges apply if equipment is modified without authorization. Exceptions include actions authorized by law, lawful employment duties, or authorized security operations.

    What Is Burglary?
  </h2>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Burglary is the unlawful entry of a dwelling, structure, or conveyance owned by another, with the intent to commit a crime. It also applies when a person remains after permission has been revoked and intends to commit a crime. In Florida, burglary is a first-degree felony that can result in life imprisonment depending on severity.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl  font-bold text-black leading-snug mt-4">
    Burglary vs. Trespassing

    While related, burglary and trespassing differ in severity:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Burglary:</strong> Unlawful entry with intent to commit a crime, charged as a felony.</li>
    <li><strong>Trespassing:</strong> Unlawful entry without criminal intent, charged as a misdemeanor.</li>

  <h2 className="text-2xl  font-bold text-black leading-snug mt-4">
    Possession of Burglary Tools
  </h2>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Carrying tools intended for burglary—like crowbars, lock picks, ropes, masks, or explosives—is illegal. Depending on the circumstances, this can be a misdemeanor or felony and result in incarceration, probation, fines, and restitution.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl  font-bold text-black leading-snug mt-4">
    Trespassing Offenses
  </h2>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
    <li>
      <strong>In Structure or Conveyance:</strong> Willful entry or remaining without permission, or refusal to leave after permission is revoked. Typically a second-degree misdemeanor (up to 60 days in jail).

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Under Florida law, a DUI means “driving under the influence”. It must be proven that your “normal faculties” were impaired due to an unlawful blood alcohol or breath alcohol level.

    With a DUI comes two separate cases – a civil one and a criminal one. The criminal case will handle the DUI charges made against you, while your driver’s license suspension will be taken care of in civil. With a DUI, you have just 10 days to deal with your license after your arrest, with your citation serving as a 10-day driving permit. During this time, you can request a formal review hearing or a hardship permit. After those 10 days, you may be subjected to longer consequences.

    Felonies / Probation
  </h2>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    McCulloch Law, P.A. has years of experience in handling almost every level of felony charge. As a former prosecutor, Drew McCulloch prosecuted thousands of felony cases. By hiring McCulloch Law, P.A. at the earliest stages of your case, our office may be able to minimize or possibly avoid certain aspects of your charges and sanctions.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    In appropriate cases, we may be able to negotiate for a “diversion program,” which, if successfully completed, could result in dismissal of your case. In some cases, we may be able to negotiate with the prosecutor and convince the state attorney to file less serious charges or no charges at all. In other cases, we may be able to argue for or provide mitigation for a better deal, such as drug rehab over jail or lesser included offenses.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    McCulloch Law, P.A. will always try to avoid an adjudication of guilt, if at all possible. An “adjudication of guilt” as opposed to a “withhold of adjudication of guilt” could make the difference between having to admit you were convicted of a criminal offense on a job application and being able to deny it. It may also make the difference between keeping or obtaining employment or being able to drive. Teachers, nurses, fiduciaries, county and city employees, even real estate agents and stock brokers may be fired or not hired simply because of a conviction for petit theft, worthless check, defrauding an innkeeper, theft of utilities, or retail theft. An adjudication on a possession of marijuana or prostitution charge, for example, carries a 2-year suspension of your Florida driver’s license. Furthermore, an adjudication may limit your ability to seal or expunge your charge.

    Misdemeanor vs. Felony
  </h3>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    In Florida, criminal charges are categorized into misdemeanors and felonies. Misdemeanors can be 2nd degree or 1st degree. Felonies can be 3rd degree, 2nd degree, 1st degree, Life, or Capital. A misdemeanor could result in jail time, whereas a felony could result in jail, prison, or death. Jail is for sentences less than 365 days and prison is for sentences greater than 365 days.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    How It Works
  </h3>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Felonies are heard in Circuit Court. In Hillsborough County, there are seven felony divisions A through I, plus specific courts for probation violations, drug offenses, juvenile offenses, and other serious offenses going to jury trial. Defendants are randomly assigned to divisions. Every felony offense requires a scoresheet, which determines if prison is mandatory and its length. Statutes may enhance sentences for repeat offenders, gun crimes, or crimes involving children.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Plea deals can be negotiated with the prosecutor or judge. The State Attorney is the only one who can amend charges. Hiring an experienced local defense attorney provides insight into specific judges and divisions.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    Punishments
  </h3>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-700">
    <li>
      <strong>3rd Degree Felonies:</strong> up to 5 years in prison, probation, and $5,000 fine.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>2nd Degree Felonies:</strong> up to 15 years in prison, probation, and $10,000 fine.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>1st Degree Felonies:</strong> up to 30 years in prison, probation, and $10,000 fine.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Capital and Life Felonies:</strong> Life or death penalty and $15,000 fine.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    Probation, Jail, and Violation of Probation
  </h3>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Violating a probation sentence could result in serving the full prison term. Sentences may be split between prison and probation. Violating probation can lead to serving the remainder of the maximum sentence in prison.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    Consecutive vs. Concurrent Sentences
  </h3>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Each charge carries its own punishment. A judge may run sentences concurrently (at the same time) or consecutively (one after the other). For example, two 3rd degree felonies each with a 5-year maximum could result in either 5 years total (concurrent) or 10 years total (consecutive).
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    Statute of Limitations
  </h3>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    See Fla. Statutes 775.15. Charges must be filed within a certain time from the crime, except for serious crimes such as murder. Examples:
  </p>

    Common Juvenile Crimes In Florida

    Just because a minor has committed a crime doesn’t mean it isn’t a serious matter. Common juvenile crimes in Florida include, but are not limited to:

    <li>Assault</li>
    <li>Battery</li>

    When a young person commits a crime, the justice system recognizes the intricacies at hand. This is why they’re tried in the Juvenile Justice System. At McCulloch Law, we understand this process thoroughly and how to get the best outcome that allows the minor to restore their livelihood and bright future as quickly as possible.

    McCulloch Law, P.A. has years of experience in handling almost every kind of misdemeanor charge.
    As a former prosecutor, Drew McCulloch prosecuted thousands of cases—misdemeanor and felony.
    By hiring McCulloch Law, P.A. at the earliest stages of your case, our office may be able to
    minimize or possibly avoid certain aspects of your charges and sanctions.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    In appropriate cases, we may be able to negotiate for a “diversion program,” which, if successfully
    completed, could result in the dismissal of your case. In some cases, we may be able to negotiate
    with the prosecutor and convince the state attorney to file less serious charges or no charges at all.
    In other cases, we may be able to provide mitigation for a better deal, such as drug rehab over jail
    or lesser included offenses.

    What You Should Know About Misdemeanors And Felonies In Florida
  </h3>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    McCulloch Law, P.A. will always try to avoid an adjudication of guilt, if at all possible. An
    “adjudication of guilt,” as opposed to a “withhold of adjudication,” could determine whether you must
    admit to a criminal conviction on a job application. It can affect employment, licensing, and even
    your ability to drive.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Teachers, nurses, fiduciaries, county and city employees, real estate agents, and stock brokers may
    lose opportunities simply because of a conviction. Certain adjudications—such as possession of
    marijuana or prostitution—carry a two-year driver’s license suspension. An adjudication may also
    prevent you from sealing or expunging your record.
  </p>

  
  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    McCulloch Handles All Misdemeanors Such As:
  </h3>

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-700">
    <li>Driving Under the Influence</li>
    <li>Battery</li>
    <li>Possession of Marijuana</li>

  </ul>

  
  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    Misdemeanor vs. Felony
  </h3>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    In Florida, criminal charges are categorized into misdemeanors and felonies. Misdemeanors can be
    1st or 2nd degree. Felonies range from 3rd degree to Capital. A misdemeanor could result in jail time,
    whereas a felony could lead to prison time. Jail sentences are under 365 days; prison sentences exceed 365 days.
  </p>

  <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mt-3">How It Works:</h4>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Misdemeanors are heard in County Court, while felonies are heard in Circuit Court.
    In Hillsborough County, misdemeanor divisions (A–G) are assigned by the defendant’s last name.
    Different judges have different sentencing styles, so an experienced local attorney is crucial.
  </p>

  
  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    Punishments
  </h3>

  <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black">2nd Degree Misdemeanors:</h4>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-700">
    <li>Up to 60 days in jail</li>
    <li>6 months probation</li>
    <li>$500+ fine</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mt-3">1st Degree Misdemeanors:</h4>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-700">
    <li>Up to 364 days in jail</li>
    <li>12 months probation</li>
    <li>$1,000+ fine</li>
  </ul>

  
  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    Probation and Jail
  </h3>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Violating probation—even on the last day—could result in serving the full jail sentence. A sentence
    can also be split between jail and probation, and violations may require completing the remaining jail time.
  </p>

  
  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    Consecutive vs. Concurrent Sentences
  </h3>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Each charge carries its own punishment. Judges may run sentences concurrently (at the same time)
    or consecutively (one after the other). Two 364-day misdemeanor sentences could become either
    364 days total or 728 days depending on the ruling.
  </p>

  
  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    Statute of Limitations
  </h3>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Florida’s statute of limitations is one year for 2nd degree misdemeanors and two years for 1st degree misdemeanors, with exceptions.
  </p>

  
  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    Serious Ramifications
  </h3>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Misdemeanors may seem minor but can affect your rights, employment, licensing, credibility, and firearm privileges.
    Some misdemeanors (DUI, battery, petit theft, DWLSR, prostitution) can be upgraded to felonies based on prior convictions.
  </p>

  
  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black mt-4">
    Habitual Misdemeanor Offenders (Florida Statute 775.0837)
  </h3>

  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    A habitual misdemeanor offender is someone with four prior qualifying misdemeanors committed within one year.
    Courts may impose jail, residential treatment, or designated residence detention for 6–364 days.
    Judges cannot sentence under this statute if the charge has been reclassified as a felony.

    Sealing a Record
  </h2>
  <p>
    By law, adult criminal records are public. When you get a record sealed, it means that access
    to that information is very restricted. This does not mean that your record is gone — certain
    officials can still view information relevant to their duties.
  </p>

  
  <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-black leading-snug">
    Expunging a Record
  </h2>
  <p>
    Expunging a record goes a step further than sealing one and is more difficult to obtain.
    Expungement completely removes your criminal record from the legal system. You must petition
    the court in order to have your record expunged.

    What Is Probation?
  </h2>

  <p>
    Probation can make or break the future of a criminal defendant.
  </p>

  <p>
    Probation is an intermediary between confinement and release. While the defendant
    is no longer in confinement, they are not in the clear. Probation is a test of sorts
    to see how they will behave and react to their limited reintroduction to society.
  </p>

    Probation can make or break the future of a criminal defendant. If an individual

    What Is Improper Exhibition Or Discharge Of A Weapon Or Firearm?
  </h2>

  <p>Contact us today to learn more about how we can assist you.</p>

  <p>
    Under Florida law, the improper exhibition of a firearm or weapon is characterized as
    showing off a weapon in a threatening or careless way. A weapon can be anything from a gun
    to a knife and must be listed under Florida’s weapon statute. This is a first-degree
    misdemeanor and can result in up to a year of jail or probation, plus a fine.
  </p>

  <p>
    Compared to other states, Florida gun law may seem lenient. But that doesn’t mean there
    aren’t harsh consequences for weapons and firearms charges. In an array of situations, the
    possession, purchase, and use of a weapon or firearm can land you in murky water. That’s
    why you need an experienced lawyer to guide you through the legal process.
  </p>

  
  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-black">
    The Consequences Of Illegal Possession Of A Firearm
  </h3>

  <p>
    Illegally possessing someone else’s property is already an issue. Just think of how that
    situation escalates when you’re caught illegally possessing a firearm. If the state proves
    that the defendant knowingly carried a firearm that was not theirs, the defendant may be
    subject to the consequences of a third-degree felony.

  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-black">
    The Consequences Of Unlicensed Carrying Of A Concealed Weapon Or Firearm Or A Felon In Possession Of A Firearm
  </h3>

  <p>
    Florida law states that the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon is broken down
    into two segments – actual possession and constructive possession. Actual possession is
    when a felon has it on or near their person, while constructive possession is when the
    firearm is in a place in which the felon has control.

  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-black">
    The Consequences Of Shooting Or Throwing A Deadly Missile

    can lead to prison.
  </p>

  
  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-black">
    The Consequences Of Possession Or Discharge Of A Destructive Device
  </h3>

  <p>
    Possessing or discharging a destructive device in Florida is when a person willfully makes
    or attempts to make, possess, project, or discharge any destructive device. A destructive
    device can be a bomb, grenade, rocket, missile, or anything that can cause major
    destruction, as defined by Florida law. Consequences vary based on severity.

  <p>
    Aggravated battery is the intentional touching of another person with the intent to harm

    with a deadly weapon. This can result in minimum prison time of 10 years, increasing with
    severity.

  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-black">
    What Is Armed Burglary Carrying A Concealed Firearm?
  </h3>

  <p>

  <p>

    What Is A Violation Of Probation (When The Underlying Offense Involved A Weapon Or Firearm)?

    Driving With a Suspended or Revoked License

  <p>
    Being pulled over while driving with a suspended or revoked license in Florida is a serious

    Many people find themselves facing this charge due to misunderstandings, unpaid tickets, or

  </p>

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside">

    Vehicular Manslaughter
  </h2>

  <p>
    Vehicular manslaughter, also known in Florida as “vehicular homicide,” is one of the most
    serious traffic-related criminal charges a person can face. It involves the killing of
    another human being—or an unborn child—caused by the reckless operation of a motor vehicle.
    Because of the severity and tragic nature of these cases, prosecutors are aggressive,
    and the penalties can be life-changing.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-black">
    What Is Vehicular Manslaughter?
  </h3>

  <p>
    Under Florida law, vehicular manslaughter occurs when a person operates a vehicle in a
    manner that is considered reckless—meaning they showed a willful or wanton disregard
    for the safety of others—and this reckless behavior results in a fatality.
  </p>

  <p>Reckless driving may include behaviors such as:</p>

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Excessive speeding or street racing</li>
    <li>Aggressive or erratic driving</li>
    <li>Driving while distracted (texting, social media, etc.)</li>
    <li>Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol</li>
    <li>Ignoring traffic signals or driving dangerously in poor weather</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-black">
    Penalties for Vehicular Manslaughter
  </h3>

  <p>
    Vehicular manslaughter is a second-degree felony in Florida, but circumstances of the case
    may elevate the charges and resulting penalties. Potential consequences include:
  </p>

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
    <li><strong>Up to 15 years in prison</strong> and significant fines</li>
    <li><strong>Felony probation</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Permanent driver’s license revocation</strong> in certain cases</li>
    <li><strong>Designation as a Habitual Traffic Offender</strong></li>
    <li>A permanent felony criminal record</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If the driver fails to stop, render aid, or remain at the scene, the charge may be upgraded
    to a first-degree felony, punishable by up to 30 years in prison.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-black">
    How We Defend Vehicular Manslaughter Cases

    Speeding and High-Speed Violations
  </h2>

  
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Speeding and high-speed violations may seem minor at first glance, but they can carry serious and long-lasting consequences.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    When an individual is accused of driving far above the posted speed limit or engaging in reckless operation of a vehicle, they may face steep fines, license points, increased insurance rates, and even potential criminal charges depending on the severity of the incident.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    High-speed violations are taken very seriously in Florida. Law enforcement and prosecutors often pursue these cases aggressively due to the heightened danger associated with extreme speeds. A conviction can affect your driving privileges, employment opportunities, and overall quality of life.
